# GOALIFY

Goalify is a goal-oriented social platform. It's a place where people with similar goals can meet, chat, track goals and be accountable for completing them successfully.

## Tech stack
* Frontend: React, Recoil JS, MUI, Bootstrap and ANT Design
* Backend: Node, Express and PostgreSQL
* API: Google Maps API, Socket IO

## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

## Features
* Find a goal to join or create your own
* User can favourite goals
* User's with same goal can chat with each other
* Track completed milestones and progress of goal
* View the location of goal on google maps (if location provided by the goal creator)
